# gen_dyn_models

Here are some scripts for dynamic models generation. They start (and restart if necessary) Android emulator, explore a given list of applications with the help of droidbot and store the models in a specified directory.
WARNING: Scripts can not be used directly on arbitrary machine as I heavily use full paths (/home/nastya/...) here.
